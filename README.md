## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS modules
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This was my first React.js challenge so there was a lot to learn just to get up and running.

I learned in CSS modules I have to use classes, can't select on elements or it wont be privatised to the component.

I learned how to deploy React app to github pages, it is a little more involved than deploying a vanilla HTML app.

I learned how to use React portals to display modals and overlays.

I learned a bit in validating the email, it was a bit finicky.

I learned the difference between App.css and index.css.
